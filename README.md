GOOGLE SOLUTION CHALLENGE 2025

TEAM NAME: EARTH
TEAM LEADER: DEEKSHA KUMARI
TEAM MEMBERS: Sadaf Shaikh, Maruf Fatema Mansuri

CATEGORY: OPEN INNOVATION
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Connecting Restaurants with NGOs.
    Every day, restaurants dispose of surplus food while millions of people struggle with hunger. At the same time, underprivileged individuals seek employment opportunities. There is a disconnect between surplus food sources and the people who need it, and NGOs often face challenges in maintaining a consistent supply chain.

Goal
    To create a technology-driven solution that connects restaurants, NGOs, and underprivileged individualsâ€”ensuring food reaches those in need while creating employment opportunities.
